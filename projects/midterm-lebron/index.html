                <p>Despite being a team sport, some NBA teams rely on a star to get them to the finals more than others.
                    Did Giannis do it without help? <em>Not really.</em> Did MJ carry Pippen? <em>Sometimes.</em> Is
                    LeBron amazing? Yes.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of opinionated articles and videos debating this already. So I figured I would add
                    my data-driven take to the mix. What do the data say about ranking the biggest Finals carry jobs in
                    NBA history?</p>
                <p>The data say that LeBron’s (losing) effort with the 2018 Cavaliers reigns supreme.</p>

                <p>To answer this I used the all-in-one advanced stat <a

                    contributed vs. what a replacement level player would. But we can’t just measure who had the highest
                    WAR in isolation since both games and minutes played factor in. It needs to be relative to the rest
                    of the team.</p>

                            together, and those with standout performances are higiher and more separated. </p>

                        <p>To rank the biggest carry jobs, I decided to look at the WAR share among the top three
                            players on
                            a team. I could’ve picked any number of players to compare, but most great teams have at
                            least
                            two or three stars, with the rest filling in as role players, so three is the magic number.

                                        the puzzle to win it all. But mostly, this is another perspective to add to
                                        these on-going debates.</p>

                            <p>Data for this story came from 538. The analysis only included players with 150+ minutes
                                played. There are a lot of metrics out there, and they can all be great and terrible.
                                Quantity matters in the playoffs, so a cumulative stat was chosen.</p>
