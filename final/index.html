            with 315 million downloads in that quarter alone. Since the launch in 2018, TikTok installs have

        <p>Hailey Bakos has a TikTok account with over six hundred thousand followers. “It was cool to see my videos
            and account gain attraction and attention as it showed people related to and enjoyed the content I
            was creating,” Bakos said.</p>

        <p>With the growing success of TikTok, it was inevitable that other apps created video content of
            their own. Instagram launched a reels feature which is extremely similar to TikTok and Snapchat
            launched a spotlight feature that allows for video content from users. What differs TikTok from the
            rest of these video features on other social media platforms is the “For You” page. The app is very
            good at aligning with users’ personal interests to customize content that they would enjoy or relate
            to.

        <p>The growing popularity of the app can be attributed to numerous factors such as authenticity, a
            sense of community, unique content that one can’t find on another social media platform, and it is a
            place for people to express themselves as they please.</p>
        <p>Users with large followings are even able to make money on the app. Some may even consider it their
            full time job. <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-make-money-on-tiktok-4-easy-strategies/"
                target="_blank">Addison Rae makes nearly $5 million per year on the app,</a> making her the highest paid
            human on Tik Tok. She is followed by Charli D’Amelio who makes $4 million a year and her sister
            Dixie D’Amelio who makes $2.9 million a year.</p>

            <p>Users can also profit off their videos from sponsored content such as paid collaborations or become
                part of TikTok’s Creator Fund. As part of the creator fund, creators can receive funds based on the
                number of views and the engagement on the content. </p>

                President Biden has overturned Trump’s ban and will re-evaluate the risk the app poses to the
                country.
