        <h4>There is no doubt that since the pandemic started in March 2020, Tik Tok has become increasingly
            popular with people of all ages. Tik Tok is a popular video streaming and social media platform. It
            is one of the fastest growing social media platforms in the world.
            <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users" target="blank">As of September
                2021, Tik Tok
                has passed 1 billion monthly users after launching in August 2018.</a>

        <h4> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users" target="blank">Tik Tok became
                the most downloaded app in the world in the beginning of 2020 once the pandemic hit
                with 315 million downloads in that quarter alone. Since the launch in 2018, Tik Tok installs have
                soared to 3.2 billion.</a>

            <h4> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users" target="blank"> ByteDance,
                    Tik Tok’s parent company based in Beijing, saw its 2020 revenue more than double from
                    2019, to $34.3 billion. By June 2021, ByteDance was valued at $425 billion.</a>
                Users can follow other accounts and also view content on the “For You” page which is generated by
                algorithms based on what the user interacts with. There is a wide variety of types of videos that
                users post on Tik Tok. From lip syncing videos, to tutorials, to comedic skits, there is a niche for
                everyone on the app. The videos can include different filters, music, and special effects to grab
                the audience's attention.

        <h4>Hailey Bakos has a Tik Tok account with over six hundred thousand followers. “It was cool to see my videos
            and account gain attraction and attention as it showed people related to and enjoyed the content I
            was creating,” Bakos said.</h4>

        <h4>With the growing success of Tik Tok, it was inevitable that other apps created video content of
            their own. Instagram launched a reels feature which is extremely similar to Tik Tok and Snapchat
            launched a spotlight feature that allows for video content from users. What differs Tik Tok from the
            rest of these video features on other social media platforms is the “For You” page. The app is very
            good at aligning with users’ personal interests to customize content that they would enjoy or relate
            to.

        <h4>The growing popularity of the app can be attributed to numerous factors such as authenticity, a
            sense of community, unique content that one can’t find on another social media platform, and it is a
            place for people to express themselves as they please.</h4>
        <h4>Users with large followings are even able to make money on the app. Some may even consider it their
            full time job. <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-make-money-on-tiktok-4-easy-strategies/"

                    President Biden has overturned Trump’s ban and will re-evaluate the risk the app poses to the
                    country.</a>
